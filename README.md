# drumkit

Basic Website that plays drum sounds when clicked on, or when keys are pressed. 

Pain Points:
- To get the fundamentals to work, I'd written ugly (but readable) looking JavaScript code. 

How I plan to overcome this?
- I've learnt about JQuery. This seems to minimize the ugliness of the code, but still keeping it readable.
